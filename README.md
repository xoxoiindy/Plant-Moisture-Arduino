## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Arduino uno, Breadbord, Jumper Wires, 16x2 LCD Display, Moisture Detection Sensor Module, and Twillio API.
 
If soil moisture was low, LED will trigger and I will receieve a text message using Twillio's API.
LCD Display was used to show the current soil moisture levels. 



## Lessons Learned:

This was a fun one! Since cheap moisture sensors are made from copper, they would start to oxidize overtime and can kill the plant.
